## Why?

All useable explorers for Solana are either built and / or backed by Validators, or people / companies with other commercial interests, or the Solana Foundation itself.

I'm not saying this is bad per se (I eventually stake my SOL with them, too), but

**I felt an independent and open-source alternative is needed**.
