## https://solana.greina.io

An independent and open-source (GPLv3) explorer for [Solana Blockchain](https://solana.com)

![Current Screenshot](screenshot.png "Current Screenshot")

This program is non-production, pre-Alpha experimental PoC.

## Why?

All useable explorers for Solana are either built and / or backed by Validators, or people / companies with other commercial interests, or the Solana Foundation itself.

I'm not saying this is bad per se (I eventually stake my SOL with them, too), but

**I felt an independent and open-source alternative is needed**.
